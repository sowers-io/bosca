# Analytics User Behavior Extension Plan

## Overview
This plan extends the existing analytics GraphQL schema to support user behavior queries as requested by the senior developer. The current implementation provides raw event tracking and basic chart data, but lacks user-centric, session-centric, and advanced content analytics.

**Prerequisites**: Complete the existing analytics implementation in `workspace/core/server/src/graphql/analytics/` first.

## Current State Assessment

### âœ… What We Have
- Complete raw event tracking (`AnalyticEvent`)
- Basic chart queries (line, bar, donut, stacked)
- Fake data generators for development
- 10+ predefined queries for visualization
- Full GraphQL schema integration

### ðŸŽ¯ What We Need to Add
- Daily/Weekly Active Users tracking
- New vs Returning user analysis
- User retention flow analysis
- Session totals and duration metrics
- Enhanced content view analytics

## Target Queries to Support

From senior developer requirements:
- **User**: Daily Active Users, Weekly Active Users, New Users, Returning Users, Retention Flow
- **Session**: Session Totals, Average Session Duration
- **Device**: Enhanced device analytics (already partially supported)
- **Content**: Content Views with detailed metrics

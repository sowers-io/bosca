Bosca’s purpose and potential are deeply rooted in the idea of managing and delivering Biblical content. As a result, it
places a strong emphasis on integrating seamlessly with a wide range of Bible formats and resources.

Currently, most Bible-related functionality is managed through [Workflows](Workflows.md). This includes parsing
[DBL Bibles](https://thedigitalbiblelibrary.org/), organizing content within Collections and Metadata, and building
relationships between various types of content through Metadata.

These integrations enable the creation of a rich, interconnected graph of Biblical content—linking verses, individuals,
events in the Bible, and derivative works such as Messages, Studies, or Plans.

Bosca also prioritizes usability on edge devices, including mobile apps. To support this, we’re developing a sharable
data format tailored for offline use. This ensures efficient access to Biblical content on devices without requiring a
constant internet connection (we'll be releasing this soon).

Furthermore, Bosca incorporates AI/ML capabilities to enhance the value of Biblical content. These advanced workflows
can assist with tasks such as creating rich annotations, building stronger content graphs, and uncovering meaningful
insights. Leveraging [Workflows](Workflows.md) for seamless integration, Bosca can deliver additional relevant content
to enrich the time spent engaging with God’s Word.

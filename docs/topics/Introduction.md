## Understanding Bosca Project Statuses

Bosca components progress through the following stages of maturity:

#### Concept

<secondary-label ref="concept"/>
Early-stage code that’s experimental or under evaluation. It should not be used in production environments.

#### Work In-Progress

<secondary-label ref="wip"/>
We've decided that the concepts can move forward.  Things are partially ready, but more needs to be done before they're ready for use.

#### Alpha

<secondary-label ref="alpha"/>

Usable in production but still evolving. Interfaces may change in ways that could break functionality, and some features
may be incomplete.

#### Beta

<secondary-label ref="beta"/>

Components are in a more stable state. While changes may still occur, we aim to minimize breaking changes.

#### Release Candidate (RC)

<secondary-label ref="rc"/>

Close to final release. The component is stable, and we’re primarily seeking feedback before it’s officially marked as
complete.

#### General Availability (GA)

<secondary-label ref="ga"/>

The component is tagged with a version and deemed stable for production use.

<note>
  This documentation is a work in progress. You may encounter sections that are incomplete or outdated. As the system evolves,

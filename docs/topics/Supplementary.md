In addition to primary content, Metadata supports **Supplementary Content**â€”auxiliary content generated by workflows.
For example, if Metadata refers to an audio or video file, a Workflow can create a transcription of the content. This
transcription can then be stored as Supplementary Content within the Metadata system, making it readily accessible for
workflows or other app integrations.

# Documents

<primary-label ref="bosca"/>
<secondary-label ref="alpha"/>

Documents extend [Metadata](Metadata.md) to allow for quickly building structured, user-facing content, such as
articles, videos, blog posts or other content designed for web pages or apps. Documents allow content editors to
leverage and organize content blocks to allow for flexibility in the ordering and flow of a document. Documents can be
built with a variety of content blocks such as media (video/audio), formatted text, images, simple text and more.

With the metadata model, all of the content blocks and documents can connect to repeatable workflows to allow for
customization and integration with AI/ML. In the future, this will enable Bosca to automatically generate
content to improve the productivity of content teams by accomplishing tasks such as:

- Auto-generate short descriptions of written content or video/audio media
- Create MP3s using AI voices for articles
- Generate transcriptions from video/audio media
- Create talk notes and discussion questions from a video/sermon/talk
- and More!

In addition, this data model allows for accessibility enhancements and localization.

We're actively building this functionality out. We hope to have an alpha version in the next couple of weeks.

Guides extend [Metadata](Metadata.md) to support building cyclical or repeatable content experiences. Guides can be
linear or calendar based. Guides leverage similar content blocks to documents and also include other popular formats for
creating engaging, short-form visual content like shorts or stories.

Guides can be used to build content types such as:

- Multi-day studies, plans, and devotionals (can be text-based or media (video/audio) based)
- Daily Story experiences (a full-screen card-based experience including text, imagery, video, and audio)
- Classroom or courses*

*Guides do not support a classroom-style experience yet, but the design allows for this support in the future.

Bosca’s focus on personalization makes Guides a powerful tool for creating customized content. By leveraging Workflows
powered by analytics, AI/ML, and insights into a user’s journey, you can deliver highly relevant and valuable
experiences tailored to your audience’s needs.

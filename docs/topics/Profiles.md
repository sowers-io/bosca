# Profiles
<primary-label ref="bosca"/>
<secondary-label ref="alpha"/>

Profiles are essential for delivering maximum value to both your users and your content. The more the system can learn
about a user, the better it can personalize their experience, prepare engaging content, and drive meaningful interactions.

**Bosca Profiles** are structured as a top-level profile with multiple attributes that provide further details about the
user. These attributes can originate directly from the user (e.g., their date of birth) or be derived from system observations
of user behavior.

## Key Features
- **Incremental Development**: Thereâ€™s no need to burden users with lengthy onboarding flows. Instead, allow them to engage
  with the system naturally, offering opportunities to gradually share information about their preferences, interests, and dislikes.
- **Implicit Insights**: Through [Bosca Analytics](Analytics.md), user feedback and system observations are processed to
  generate implicit attributes. For instance, if a user frequently enjoys specific types of content, the system can generate
  recommendations or curated collections aligned with their preferences.

By combining explicit user inputs with implicit system-derived data, **Bosca Profiles** evolve dynamically, enabling
tailored experiences seamlessly via the AI/ML enabled workflows that can interact with the data as it flows through
the system.

description: Bosca supports different ways of to operationalize itself.

## **Docker Compose**
For simplicity, we provide a **Docker Compose** deployment option. This setup is quick to configure and suitable for
production use in smaller environments. However, it is not as scalable as other solutions, like **Kubernetes** or
**serverless environments** (e.g., Google Cloud Run). The Docker Compose configuration closely mirrors the Kubernetes
setup, making it an excellent option for testing or small-scale deployments.

## **Kubernetes (Preferred)**
Our preferred deployment method is **Kubernetes**, as it provides scalable, efficient operation with minimal effort.
Its features, such as cost optimization and operational efficiency, align perfectly with running Bosca in larger
environments. Additionally, our extensive experience with Kubernetes makes it ideal for scalable solutions.

## **Serverless (Early Stage)**
Bosca can also be deployed in **serverless environments**, although certain components, such as specific data stores,
may require specialized handling. Thanks to the use of technologies like **Rust**, **AOT Mode for C#**, and **GraalVM
Native Image for JVM**, most Bosca services deliver fast startup times, efficient runtime performance, and low memory
usage. These optimizations make **serverless deployments** an attractive long-term option for resource-efficient operation,
especially for scaling cost-effectively.

**_Note:_** While many components are compatible with serverless setups, this deployment method is still in its early stages
and hasn’t been extensively tested. We plan to focus more on this area in the future as other priorities are addressed.


## Deployment Requirements

The hardware requirements for deploying Bosca depend on several factors, including your deployment environment, selected
components, and expected workload. Key considerations include:

- **Environment Type**: Different deployment methods (e.g., Docker Compose, Kubernetes, serverless) will have varying
  hardware needs.
- **Load and Scaling**: Higher traffic and data volumes require more robust hardware to maintain performance.
- **Caching Strategy**: Leveraging a CDN and implementing an effective caching strategy can reduce hardware demands.
- **Workflow Speed**: The speed at which workflows need to be processed will impact your resource requirements.
- **Redundancy and Failover**: Enabling high availability (e.g., primary and secondary PostgreSQL for failover) or
  redundancy will increase resource utilization.
- **Backup Frequency**: Regular backups can impact your system's performance and overall resource usage.  But, will
  also reduce your operational risks.
- **Observability**: Observability is very powerful in understanding the performance and health of your system, but
  it comes at a cost.

## Deployment Cost and Scaling Considerations

Bosca is designed to operate efficiently, with the ability to run on a $6/month server in minimal configurations. However, this
setup comes with limitations in scalability and available components. With a well-planned CDN strategy, such a minimal
setup might be sufficient for smaller use cases. As your demand grows, you can seamlessly migrate to a more robust
infrastructure by planning ahead.

## Choosing a Cloud Provider

Selecting the right cloud provider is a critical decision that depends on your budget and growth expectations. Here are
some key factors to consider:

- **Budget Planning**
    - Define both the upper and lower limits of your budget.
    - Factor in how quickly you might need to scale based on user growth.
    - Assess the expected traffic patterns—is your user base steady or spikey?
    - Determine an effective caching strategy to reduce costs and enhance performance.
- **Provider Recommendations**
    - For new and smaller-scale deployments, **DigitalOcean** is highly recommended for its straightforward pricing and
      affordable offerings.
    - As your operations grow, providers like **Google Cloud** or **AWS** offer competitive pricing, particularly if you
      can commit to multi-year agreements. These are great for long-term scaling but may not fit smaller budgets.

## CDN Recommendations

An effective CDN strategy is critical to optimizing costs and improving system performance. Recommended options include:

- **Cloudflare**
    - Ideal for beginners, with a generous free tier and an affordable Pro plan.
    - Suitable for moderate traffic and bandwidth needs.
- **Fastly**
    - A strong alternative for businesses transitioning to higher-tier plans (e.g., Business or Enterprise).
- **Cloud Provider CDNs**
    - Many providers, like **AWS**, offer integrated CDN options for specific use cases.

For most deployments, **Cloudflare** is a great starting point due to its balance of cost-effectiveness and ease of use, especially for those just beginning or managing moderate workloads.

## Start Small, Scale Smart

Starting with a smaller, cost-effective setup like DigitalOcean and a good CDN (e.g., Cloudflare) allows you to minimize
expenses while maintaining flexibility. As your system’s needs grow, transitioning to larger-scale solutions becomes much
easier when properly planned.

To accommodate a range of deployments, many Bosca components can be distributed across multiple providers and systems.
While this approach may introduce some additional latency, it offers flexibility—allowing you to start on platforms like
DigitalOcean and later migrating to AWS or Google Cloud with ease. You can even distribute infrastructure, such as
keeping some services on DigitalOcean running components like the Bosca Server while runners are operating within
Google Cloud leveraging Vertex AI.

Your configuration will ultimately depend on your scaling needs, infrastructure and operational requirements, and cost
optimization strategies.

## Small Deployment

For small deployments, like a blog, you can effectively run most of the Bosca components on a $12/mo DigitalOcean
droplet.  While it's possible to run on a \$6/mo droplet, the extra 1GB of RAM will come in handy for things like 
search.
